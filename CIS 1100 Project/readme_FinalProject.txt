/******* DETAILS ON EACH FILE *********/

1. Cell.java - "This file contains an interface Cell, that is implemented 
               by two classes. It contains 6 abstract methods and one static 
               final variable. The purpose of this interface is to give mine
               cells and number cells the same static type, in order for them
               to be stored in the same 2D array. Also because the two types of 
               cells execute similar methods."

2. NumberCell.java - "This is a subtype of the interface Cell. The objects of 
                      this class represent the minesweeper cells that do not 
                      contain mines. The purpose of this class is to specifically
                      manipulate these type of cells and not the mine cells. This
                      class clearly differentiates these number cells from the 
                      mine cells. A description of the functions in this class
                      are indicated on the function headers."

3. MineCell.java - "This class is a subtype of the interface Cell. The objects of 
                    this class represent the cells with mines. The purpose of this
                    class is to specifically manipulate these mines cells, as every
                    mine cell has some attributes with different values as 
                    compared to the number cells. A description of the functions
                    in this class are indicated on the function headers."


4. Board.java - "This class represents the 'board' of the game as well as the 
                attributes and methods the board can exhibit. Every main part of
                the game is in this class. The purpose of this class is to detect 
                the state of the game and then update it based on the player's cell
                selection choice. It determines whether the player loses, wins,
                or goes on with the game. A description of the functions in this
                class are indicated on the function headers. "

5. Minesweeper.java - "This class creates a new Board and Cell[][]. The purpose of
                        this class is to organise the game. It combines the 
                        functions of the other classes and restructures them in a 
                        way that defines how the game should proceed. "


/************************** FEEDBACK TIME ****************************/

"Honestly speaking, I found this project to be really fun. Despite those bits of 
frustration when the code does not work and you don't know why, the satisfaction 
that comes after seeing the end result is totally worth it."

"Throughout this semester, I would say this class has been one of my favourite 
classes. I'd say it's a really good way of introducing coding to people who have
had zero experience. I too had never coded a single line of code prior to this 
class, and now I just make a game."

"The lectures were good, Harry and Eric are really good Professors. My TAs, Wenny
and Bhrajit, are the absolute best. Though their recitation was the longest class I 
had, it was one of my favourite classes."
